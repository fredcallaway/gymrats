# Gym Rats

A work-in-progress repository featuring basic RL algorithms for simple discrete environments. All agents and environments use the standard OpenAI gym interface. Pull requests, issues, and general questions are all more than welcome!

P.S. No promises that everything runs correctly, especially anything in demo.py
